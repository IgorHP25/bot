# HG::Weather

Now you can simply get current and forecast data from HG Weather API directly on your Ruby Application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hg-weather'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hg-weather

## Usage

### Configuring

You can configure all of HG Weather params, but not of them are required.

```ruby
require 'hg/weather'

HG::Weather.setup do |config|
  # You can generate your key on hgbrasil.com/weather
  # Key is required for search by name, geolocation or IP.
  config.api_key = 'my-key'

  # Use SSL on request, default and recommended is true
  config.use_ssl = true

  # Coming... If you are using Rails, request can be cached on cache engine
  config.use_rails_cache = true

  # config.cid = 'BRXX0198' # set default City ID
  # config.city_name = 'Ribeirao Preto' # set city name for search
  # config.latitude = -41.0 # set latitude
  # config.longitude = -41.0 # set longitude
  # config.client_ip = :remote # your IP or 'remote' to get automatically
end

# You also can change setup parameters directly
HG::Weather.api_key = 'my-key'
```

### Usage
```ruby
require 'hg/weather'

# You can set any search API parameter here
weather = HG::Weather.get(cid: 'BRXX0198')

weather.key_status # => :empty (can be :empty, :valid or :invalid)

weather.city_name # => 'RibeirÃ£o Preto'
weather.search_method # => 'cid'
weather.cid # => 'BRXX0198'

# Will return a HG::Weather::Data object, with current weather data

weather.condition.temperature # => HG::Weather::Temperature
weather.condition.temperature.celsius # => 23.0
weather.condition.temperature.fahrenheit # => 73.4

weather.condition.wind_speed # => HG::Weather::Speed

weather.condition.sunrise # => Time object (time of sunrise)
weather.condition.sunset # => Time object (time of sunset)

weather.forecast
# Will return an array with HG::Weather::Data object, with future weather conditions

weather.forecast.each do |forecast|
  forecast.max_temperature.celsius # => 31.0
  forecast.min_temperature.celsius # => 20.0
  forecast.description # => 'Parcialmente nublado' (on native country location)
  forecast.slug # => :cloudly_night

end

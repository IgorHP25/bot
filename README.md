# HG Weather

Welcome to official HG Weather's Ruby Gem!

Now you can simple get worldwide current and forecast data from HG Weather API directly on your Ruby Application, of any city in the world!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hg-weather'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hg-weather

## Usage

### Configuring

You can configure all of HG Weather params, but not all of them are required.

```ruby
require 'hg/weather'

HG::Weather.setup do |config|
  # You can generate your key on hgbrasil.com/weather
  # Key is required for search by name, geolocation or IP.
  config.api_key = 'my-key'

  # Set locale for response, default is english, available: pt-br, en
  config.locale = :en

  # Use SSL on request, default and recommended is true
  config.use_ssl = true

  # Coming... If you are using Rails, request can be cached on cache engine
  config.use_rails_cache = true

  # You can set default search, by these methods below:

  # config.woeid = '2487956' # set default with an WOEID (Where on Earth ID)
  # config.city_name = 'Cupertino, CA' # set city name for search
  # config.latitude = -41.0 # set latitude
  # config.longitude = -41.0 # set longitude
  # config.client_ip = :remote # your IP or 'remote' to get automatically
  # config.cid = 'BRXX0198' # search by CID, deprecated and only for Brazil
end

# You also can change setup parameters directly
HG::Weather.api_key = 'my-key'
HG::Weather.locale = 'pt-br'
...
```
